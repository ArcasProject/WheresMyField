## What's the concept?

I'm new to a research field. I could spend six months on a literature review in order to understand key papers, people, and the journals and conferences relevant to my field.

Or I could do a quick web search using the power of extensive metadata for scholarly literature. Existing services include Web of Knowledge (closed), the Microsoft Academic API (free up to a point), CORE (search engine only) and Yewno Discover (closed). These allow me to explore the data, but not necassarily to make much sense of it or help me use it.

## Example user journey

At WheresMyField, I enter a term that is relevant to my new field. I'm interested in game theory. Let's search for that.

WheresMyField uses scholarly literature metadata to present concepts, authors, journals and conferences relevant to my search term.

I can use the web app to:

1. Learn the lingo - learn and understand the top terms commonly associated with my search term in the research literature. Perhaps one term better describes my interest - I can search for that instead. Or perhaps I want to use these additional concepts to refine my search (including relevant, excluding irrelevant terms).

Once I have a better grasp of the concepts in my field, I can use my refined search to:

2. Crack the community - WheresMyField lists the top authors of publications in my field. I can explore the networked of connected authors. I think there's something about Maria: let me dig deeper to find out more about her. I can find out where she works, what sheâ€™s published, who she collaborates with, and link to external services like ORCiD, LinkedIn and ResearchGate. It looks like Maria is worth knowing; I'll add her to my list of people to connect with (my future friends).

Now that I know roughly what the field is about and who the key people are (historically), let's see if I can work out where to look for new research:

3. Find the field lists the most popular journals and conferences for my field, so that I can follow the relevant research feeds, and find the right meetings to go to. I can dive into a journal's article listing and search for an open-access copy of the latest research using Unpaywall/the OA-doi, or make a requst for the author to provide an archive copy using the OA button. I can explore upcoming conferences, and find out more, submit, or register. Integration with calendar apps (using Cronofy API) will mean easy scheduling.

## Let's recap
WheresMyField is the entry point to all my meta-research activities: I can understand related concepts in my research area (like Yewno Discover), I can find the latest research and identify potential collaborators, and I can make sure I'm at the key conferences I need to be at. WheresMyField is a user-focussed app to empower researchers to stay on top of the latest research and manage their meta-research activities using the wealth of scholarly metadata already at our fingertips.
